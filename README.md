# yt
A massively simple frontend for archiving local music off youtube-dl for historical purposes.

## Use
Copy a link to a uncopyrighted song or album on youtube. Then open the application. It will automatically download the song in the highest available audio format to the configured folder.

## Configuration
Within the directory of the application there is generated a file named "config.csv", inside this file are three settings.
* _savefolder - The folder where you would like to save all the downloaded music.
* _playlistFileNameFormat - The naming format when downloading a playlist.
* _singleFileNameFormat - The naming format when downloading a single song.

## Notes
This program is not efficient or well programmed, it was just a quick ugly hack to avoid having to use command prompt to "archive local music". Don't judge me.
